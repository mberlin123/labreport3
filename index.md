There are many useful commands in Bash. One example of a useful command is `find`. In it's most basic form with no arguments, `find` lists all of the files and subdirectories in the current directory as well as any files and subdirectories within a subdirectory of the current directory.

For example, in the following directory:

```/Pictures
    /January
        birthdaycake.png
    /Feburary
        newdog.png
    pictureideas.txt
```
