# Lab Report 3

There are many useful commands in Bash. One example of a useful command is `find`. In it's most basic form with no arguments, `find` lists all of the files and subdirectories in the current directory as well as any files and subdirectories within a subdirectory of the current directory.

To demonstrate the `find` command in this report, the following example directory will be used:

```
/Pictures
    /January
        birthdaycake.png
    /Feburary
        newdog.png
    pictureideas.txt
```
